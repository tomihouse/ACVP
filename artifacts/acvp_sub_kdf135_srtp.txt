1.  Introduction

   The Automated Crypto Validation Protocol (ACVP) defines a mechanism
   to automatically verify the cryptographic implementation of a
   software or hardware crypto module.  The ACVP specification defines
   how a crypto module communicates with an ACVP server, including
   crypto capabilities negotiation, session management, authentication,
   vector processing and more.  The ACVP specification does not define
   algorithm specific JSON constructs for performing the crypto
   validation.  A series of ACVP sub-specifications define the
   constructs for testing individual crypto algorithms.  Each sub-
   specification addresses a specific class of crypto algorithms.  This
   sub-specification defines the JSON constructs for testing SP800-135
   SRTP KDF algorithms using ACVP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Capabilities Registration

   ACVP requires crypto modules to register their capabilities.  This
   allows the crypto module to advertise support for specific
   algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test
   vectors generated for the validation process.  This section describes

   the constructs for advertising support of SP800-135 SRTP KDF
   algorithms to the ACVP server.

   The algorithm capabilities are advertised as JSON objects within the
   'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message.  The
   'algorithms' value is an array, where each array element is an
   individual JSON object defined in this section.  The 'algorithms'
   value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON
   registration message.  See the ACVP specification for details on the
   registration message.  Each KDF algorithm capability advertised is a
   self-contained JSON object.

2.1.  Required Prerequisite Algorithms for KDF135 SRTP Validations

   Some KDF135 algorithm implementations rely on other cryptographic
   primitives.  For example, SRTP uses an underlying SHA algorithm.
   Each of these underlying algorithm primitives must be validated,
   either separately or as part of the same submission.  ACVP provides a
   mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

   Note: Some optional values are required depending on the algorithm.
   Failure to provide these values will result in the ACVP server
   returning an error to the ACVP client during registration.

3.  Test Vectors

   The ACVP server provides test vectors to the ACVP client, which are
   then processed and returned to the ACVP server for validation.  A
   typical ACVP validation session would require multiple test vector
   sets to be downloaded and processed by the ACVP client.  Each test
   vector set represents an individual Key Derivation Function (KDF),
   such as SNMP, SSH, etc.  This section describes the JSON schema for a
   test vector set used with SP800-135 SRTP KDF algorithms.

   The test vector set JSON schema is a multi-level hierarchy that
   contains meta data for the entire vector set as well as individual
   test vectors to be processed by the ACVP client.The following table
   describes the JSON elements at the top level of the hierarchy.

   object is an array of test groups.  Test vectors are grouped into
   similar test cases to reduce the amount of data transmitted in the

   meta data that applies to all test vectors within the group.  The

   Group JSON object.

                     Table 4: Vector Group JSON Object

3.2.  Test Case JSON Schema

   Each test group contains an array of one or more test cases.  Each
   test case is a JSON object that represents a single test vector to be
   processed by the ACVP client.  The following table describes the JSON
   elements for each SP800-135 SRTP KDF test vector.

   +------------+-----------------------------------+-------+----------+
   | JSON Value | Description                       | JSON  | Optional |
   |            |                                   | type  |          |

   |            | vector set.                       |       |          |
   |            |                                   |       |          |

4.  Test Vector Responses

   After the ACVP client downloads and processes a vector set, it must
   send the response vectors back to the ACVP server.  The following
   table describes the JSON object that represents a vector set
   response.

   +------------+---------------------------------------------+--------+
   | JSON Value | Description                                 | JSON   |
   |            |                                             | type   |
   +------------+---------------------------------------------+--------+
   | acvVersion | Protocol version identifier                 | value  |
   |            |                                             |        |
   | vsId       | Unique numeric identifier for the vector    | value  |
   |            | set                                         |        |
   |            |                                             |        |
   | testGroups | Array of JSON objects that represent each   | array  |
   |            | test vector group. See                      |        |
   |            | Table 7                                     |        |
   |            |                                             |        |
   +------------+---------------------------------------------+--------+

                 Table 6: Vector Set Response JSON Object

   The testGroups section is used to organize the ACVP client response
   in a similar manner to how it receives vectors.  Several algorithms
   SHALL require the client to send back group level properties in their
   response.  This structure helps accommodate that.

   +-----------+--------------------------------------------+----------+
   | JSON      | Description                                | JSON     |
   | Value     |                                            | type     |
   +-----------+--------------------------------------------+----------+
   | tgId      | The test group Id                          | value    |
   |           |                                            |          |
   | tests     | The tests associated to the group          | value    |
   |           | specified in tgId                          |          |
   |           |                                            |          |
   +-----------+--------------------------------------------+----------+

              Table 7: Vector Set Group Response JSON Object

   The following table describes the JSON object that represents a
   vector set response for SRTP.
